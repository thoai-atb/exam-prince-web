        {
          "question": "How does cloud storage enhance data availability in databases?",
          "correctAnswer": "By storing data across multiple remote servers to avoid single points of failure.",
          "wrongAnswer1": "By restricting access to data during peak hours.",
          "wrongAnswer2": "By limiting data to local physical storage devices.",
          "wrongAnswer3": "By requiring users to manually synchronize data.",
          "explanation": "Cloud storage enhances availability by distributing data across many servers, preventing data loss if one server fails, unlike local storage or manual synchronization.",
