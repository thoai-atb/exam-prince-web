          "wrongAnswer3": "Handling a button click immediately without delay",
          "explanation": "Throttling is often used in scenarios like scroll events where the event can fire very frequently, and limiting how often the handler runs improves performance and responsiveness.",

          "question": "How does throttling differ from debouncing in JavaScript?",
          "correctAnswer": "Throttling ensures a function is called at regular intervals, debouncing delays the function call until event stops",
          "wrongAnswer1": "Throttling calls a function only once, debouncing calls it multiple times",
          "wrongAnswer2": "Throttling delays a function call until no events occur, debouncing limits the rate of calls",
          "wrongAnswer3": "Throttling and debouncing are identical and interchangeable techniques",
          "explanation": "Throttling and debouncing are both rate-limiting techniques but serve different purposes: throttling triggers function execution at regular intervals, while debouncing waits until the events have stopped firing to trigger the function once.",

          "question": "What is the main advantage of using event delegation in JavaScript?",
          "correctAnswer": "It allows a single event listener to handle events for multiple child elements efficiently.",
          "wrongAnswer1": "It automatically prevents all events from bubbling up.",
          "wrongAnswer2": "It eliminates the need for event listeners entirely.",
          "wrongAnswer3": "It only works with form elements.",
          "explanation": "Event delegation leverages event bubbling to manage events for multiple child elements through a single event handler attached to their common ancestor, improving performance and simplifying management.",
          "difficulty": "Basic"
        },
        {
          "question": "Which DOM event property is commonly checked in event delegation to identify the specific child element that triggered the event?",
          "correctAnswer": "event.target",
          "wrongAnswer1": "event.currentTarget",
          "wrongAnswer2": "event.delegateTarget",
          "wrongAnswer3": "event.sourceElement",
          "explanation": "In event delegation, event.target refers to the actual element that initiated the event, allowing the handler on a parent element to distinguish which child triggered it.",
          "difficulty": "Intermediate"
        },
        {
          "question": "Why is event delegation particularly useful when elements are dynamically added to the DOM?",
          "correctAnswer": "Because the parent element's event listener can handle events from elements added later without needing new listeners.",
          "wrongAnswer1": "Because it blocks events from reaching dynamically added elements.",
          "wrongAnswer2": "Because it copies event listeners to new elements automatically.",
          "wrongAnswer3": "Because dynamically added elements cannot have event listeners.",
          "explanation": "Event delegation works by attaching a single listener to a parent element which can handle events from any children, even those added after the listener was set up, avoiding the need to add listeners to each new element.",
