          "question": "Why is cross-platform compatibility important for NodeJS?",
          "correctAnswer": "It allows developers to run the same code on different operating systems without changes",
          "wrongAnswer1": "It limits the code to be used only on a single operating system",
          "wrongAnswer2": "It makes the code slower on non-Windows machines",
          "wrongAnswer3": "It requires rewriting the code for each operating system",
          "explanation": "Cross-platform compatibility in NodeJS allows developers to write code once and execute it on multiple operating systems, improving flexibility and reducing development time.",
