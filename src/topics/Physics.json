          "question": "In the Lorentz transformation, what happens to the length of an object moving at a velocity close to the speed of light as observed from a stationary frame?",
          "correctAnswer": "It appears contracted (length contraction) along the direction of motion",
          "wrongAnswer1": "It appears to increase in length",
          "wrongAnswer2": "It stays the same as in the object's rest frame",
          "wrongAnswer3": "It becomes undefined due to infinite velocity",
          "explanation": "According to the Lorentz transformation, an object moving close to the speed of light relative to an observer appears shortened along the direction of motion, an effect known as length contraction.",

          "wrongAnswer2": "The theory of relativity",
          "wrongAnswer3": "Classical electromagnetism",
          "explanation": "Quantum tunneling occurs because particles exhibit wave-like behavior, allowing them to have a non-zero probability to be found on the other side of a barrier due to the probabilistic nature of their wavefunctions.",
