          "question": "How does Terraform find and install provider plugins when you run 'terraform init'?",
          "correctAnswer": "It downloads the required provider plugins from the Terraform Registry or other configured sources.",
          "wrongAnswer1": "You must manually download and place them in the Terraform installation directory.",
